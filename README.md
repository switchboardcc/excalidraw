# Switchboard on Excalidraw

## Overview

This repository showcases what creating a growth experience with Switchboard looks like. For this demo, we'll be building on top of [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw), an open source tool for drawing and diagramming. We've also pulled in some basic UI components from [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), a React component library.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) (v1 or v2.4.2+)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Getting started

Follow these steps to get running with a local Excalidraw environment.

1. Clone the repo with `git clone git@github.com:switchboardcc/excalidraw.git`
2. Install the dependencies with `yarn install`
3. Start the app with `yarn start`
4. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Walkthrough

Our goal is to build a tour for first time users on top of Excalidraw. This tour will have a few steps:

1. Welcome to Excalidraw
2. Show how to use the rectangle tool
3. Show how to draw on the canvas
4. Show how to export a drawing
5. Congratulate the user on getting onboarded

We'll also have a diverging path after drawing a rectangle for users who are part of larger organizations:

4. Show how to share a drawing
5. Congratulate the user on getting onboarded

## Modeling

Models are a Switchboard concept and is the building block for defining the pieces of state that you need as part of your growth experience. In this case, weâ€™re building out a tour so one way to think about it is to add a model for each step in the tour.

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/604167/157954142-f98a4161-7312-4014-aae5-6d86aa74d0ef.png)](https://www.figma.com/proto/AKdbZcyjjkuhPiz0LLN0fG/Prototype-Storyboard?page-id=42%3A206&node-id=42%3A207&viewport=241%2C48%2C0.03&scaling=contain&starting-point-node-id=42%3A207)

Before we start implementing our tour UI, we'll need to model what state we want Switchboard to keep track for us in the Switchboard journey builder. Check out [this prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/AKdbZcyjjkuhPiz0LLN0fG/Prototype-Storyboard?page-id=42%3A206&node-id=42%3A207&viewport=241%2C48%2C0.03&scaling=contain&starting-point-node-id=42%3A207) to get a sense of what that looks like.

## API

The Switchboard API offers access to limited access to `Users` and `States` in this prototype.

### Users

A user represents an end-user of a product that has Switchboard integrated into it.

#### Attributes
id `string`<br>
Unique identifier for the user<br>

firstname `string`<br>
The first name of the user<br>

lastname `string`<br>
The first name of the user<br>

email `string`<br>
The email of the user<br>



#### Endpoints
```
GET /api/users
GET /api/users/{user-id} // the DB has been seeded with users with id 1 through 100
```

### States

The state API allows you to access the state of some model for a given user.

#### Attributes
started `boolean`<br>
RW attribute indicating whether the user has began interacting with the experience<br>

finished `boolean`<br>
RW attribute indicating whether the user has finished interacting with the experience<br>

active `boolean`<br>
RO attribute indicating whether this model is active for this user<br>

#### Endpoints
```
GET   /api/users/{user-id}/states
GET   /api/users/{user-id}/states/{state-id}
PUT   /api/users/{user-id}/states/{state-id} // State attributes in body
POST  /api/users/{user-id}/states/reset      // Convience enpoint for resetting a users State
```


## SDK

## Installation

Via Yarn
```bash
yarn add @switchboardcc/react-sdk-proto
```
Via npm
```bash
npm install @switchboardcc/react-sdk-proto
```

## Usage

### Wire the Provider and Identifying Users

```javascript
import { SbProvider } from "@switchboardcc/react-sdk-proto"
import YourApp from './YourApp';

const rootElement = document.getElementById('root');
ReactDOM.render(  
   <SbProvider userId={userId}>    
     <YourApp />  
   </SbProvider>,  
   rootElement
);
```

### Accessing states

Having wired up the `<SbProvider />` you can now access 
Switchboard state from anywhere in `<YourApp />` using 
our provided hook `useSbState($model-reference-id$)`
which can be described via the following types

#### Type Definition
```
interface State {
  readonly active: boolean;
  started: boolean;
  finished: boolean;
}

const useSbState: (modelReferenceId: string) => [State, (state: State) => void];

```
#### Usage
```javascript
import { useSbState } from "@switchboardcc/react-sdk-proto"

const WelcomeModal = () => {
  const [state, setState] = useSbState("welcome-cf7230a");

  if (!state) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <Modal isOpen={state.active && !state.finished}>
      <ModalContent border="1px" borderColor="gray.200">
        <ModalBody p={7}>
          I'm a modal whose existence/visibility is controlled by Switchboard
        </ModalBody>
      </ModalContent>
    </Modal>
  );
};
```
