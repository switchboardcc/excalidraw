# Switchboard on Excalidraw

## Overview

This repository showcases what creating a growth experience with Switchboard looks like. For this demo, we'll be building on top of [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw), an open source tool for drawing and diagramming. We've also pulled in some basic UI components from [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), a React component library.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) (v1 or v2.4.2+)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Getting started

Follow these steps to get running with a local Excalidraw environment.

1. Clone the repo with `git clone git@github.com:switchboardcc/excalidraw.git`
2. Install the dependencies with `yarn install`
3. Start the app with `yarn start`
4. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Walkthrough

Our goal is to build a tour for first time users on top of Excalidraw. This tour will have a few steps:

1. Welcome to Excalidraw
2. Show how to use the rectangle tool
3. Show how to draw on the canvas
4. Show how to export a drawing
5. Congratulate the user on getting onboarded

We'll also have a diverging path after drawing a rectangle for users who are part of larger organizations:

4. Show how to share a drawing
5. Congratulate the user on getting onboarded

## Modeling

Models are a Switchboard concept and is the building block for defining the pieces of state that you need as part of your growth experience. In this case, weâ€™re building out a tour so one way to think about it is to add a model for each step in the tour.

Before we start implementing our tour UI, we'll need to model what state we want Switchboard to keep track for us in the Switchboard journey builder. Check out [this prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/AKdbZcyjjkuhPiz0LLN0fG/Prototype-Storyboard?page-id=42%3A206&node-id=42%3A207&viewport=241%2C48%2C0.03&scaling=contain&starting-point-node-id=42%3A207) to get a sense of what that looks like.

## API

The Switchboard API offers access to limited access to `Users` and `States` in this prototype.

### Users

A user represents an end-user of a product that has Switchboard integrated into it.

#### Attributes
id `string`<br>
Unique identifier for the user<br>

firstname `string`<br>
The first name of the user<br>

lastname `string`<br>
The first name of the user<br>

email `string`<br>
The email of the user<br>



#### Endpoints
```
GET /api/users
GET /api/users/{user-id} // the DB has been seeded with users with id 1 through 100
```

### States

The state API allows you to access the state of some model for a given user.

#### Attributes
started `boolean`<br>
RW attribute indicating whether the user has began interacting with the experience<br>

finished `boolean`<br>
RW attribute indicating whether the user has finished interacting with the experience<br>

active `boolean`<br>
RO attribute indicating whether this model is active for this user<br>

#### Endpoints
```
GET /api/users/{user-id}/states
GET /api/users/{user-id}/states/{state-id}
PUT /api/users/{user-id}/states/{state-id} //Only RW State attributes in body
POST /api/users/{user-id}/states/reset // Convience enpoint for resetting a users State (given the lack of a UI)
```
