# Switchboard on Excalidraw

## Overview

This repository showcases what creating a growth experience with Switchboard looks like. For this demo, we'll be building on top of [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw), an open source tool for drawing and diagramming. We've also pulled in some basic UI components from [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), a React component library.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) (v1 or v2.4.2+)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Getting started

Follow these steps to get running with a local Excalidraw environment.

1. Clone the repo with `git clone git@github.com:switchboardcc/excalidraw.git`
2. Install the dependencies with `yarn install`
3. Start the app with `yarn start`
4. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Walkthrough

Our goal is to build a tour for first time users on top of Excalidraw. This tour will have a few steps:

1. Welcome to Excalidraw
2. Show how to use the rectangle tool
3. Show how to draw on the canvas
4. Show how to export a drawing
5. Congratulate the user on getting onboarded

We'll also have a diverging path after drawing a rectangle for users who are part of larger organizations:

4. Show how to share a drawing
5. Congratulate the user on getting onboarded

## Modeling

Models are a Switchboard concept and is the building block for defining the pieces of state that you need as part of your growth experience. In this case, weâ€™re building out a tour so one way to think about it is to add a model for each step in the tour.

[![Switchboard journey builder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/604167/157758915-fb38445f-8696-4916-a397-e99bae1baf38.png)](https://www.figma.com/proto/AKdbZcyjjkuhPiz0LLN0fG/Prototype-Storyboard?page-id=42%3A206&node-id=42%3A207&viewport=241%2C48%2C0.03&scaling=contain&starting-point-node-id=42%3A207)

Before we start implementing our tour UI, we'll need to model what state we want Switchboard to keep track for us in the Switchboard journey builder. Check out [this prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/AKdbZcyjjkuhPiz0LLN0fG/Prototype-Storyboard?page-id=42%3A206&node-id=42%3A207&viewport=241%2C48%2C0.03&scaling=contain&starting-point-node-id=42%3A207) to get a sense of what that looks like.
